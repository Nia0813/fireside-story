    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>Jackson thought he was going to go out camping but the storm put a damper on his plans.</p>
    <p>While waiting on his friend to respond to his text to come over and watch a movie instead, Jackson decided to pop some popcorn.</p>
    <p>Jackson was trying really hard not eat the popcorn until his friend came over but decided to just pop another bag once his friend arrived.</p>
