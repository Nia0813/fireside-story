    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>Jackson thought he was going to go out camping but the storm put a damper on his plans.</p>
    <p>While waiting on his friend to respond to his text to come over and watch a movie instead, Jackson decided to pop some popcorn.</p>
    <p>Jackson was trying really hard not eat the popcorn until his friend came over but decided to just pop another bag once his friend arrived.</p>
    <p>While eating popcorn, Jackson heard his cell phone ringing in the other room and went to answer it.</p>
    <p>It was Billy, his cousin. He wanted to come over for the weekend. What was Jackson to do? He already had Tommy coming over for a movie <br>
        but he couldn't tell his family no. He started to have some anexity. Billy and Tommy don't get along. I can't do this he thought. <br>
        I will just cancel everything and tell both of them I don't feel well. Then his mom came into the room smiling. "I just got off the phone with <br>
        your aunt" she said.
        <p>Oh no, busted! Jackson knew he had to think fast.</p>
